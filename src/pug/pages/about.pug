                    h1.title Nothing saps a woman’s confidence faster than hair loss.
                    p.text Strong, thick, healthy hair is associated with youth and vitality, and is considered an essential part of a woman’s natural beauty.
                    p.text It’s no wonder then, so many women feel deeply embarrassed or even ashamed by their hair loss. Afraid of what others will think, they disguise their receding hairlines and thinning hair with short haircuts or volumizers.
                    p.text And because everyone talks about men’s hair loss, but not women’s, they often feel like they’re the only ones in the world who are struggling with it.

                    h3.title Know this: You are not alone.
                    p.text Pregnancy, menopause, aging, illness, injury, medication, weight changes, and stress are just some of the reasons why many women suffer from some form of hair loss by the time they turn 40.
                    p.text But you don’t have to accept that “it’s just a part of life” or “that’s the way it is.” Or resign yourself to using conventional treatments such as laser therapy or chemical applications to treat your hair.
                    
                    h3.title We’re here to help you fight it. Naturally.
                    p.text At Zense, our mission is to help you reclaim your confidence and inner pride by giving you back naturally gorgeous, thick, and healthy hair.
                    p.text Using only organic, natural essences and extracts that nourish your hair from root to tip, promote new hair growth, and strengthen your existing hair.
                    p.text No matter your age, or what you’re going through in your life.
